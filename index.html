    <h2> A Brief History of Peru:</h2>
    <p>
    Peru began with ancient civilizations such as the Incan Empire. The Incan Empire became the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. In 1532, Spanish conquistadors captured the Incan Emperor, which lead to the fall of the empire and the colonization of Peru. Peru wasn't founded by one person, but by many people upset with the corrupt viceroyalty that Spain placed in leadership. Peru declared independence from Spain in 1821, but afterwards, Peru was riddled with political instability and conflicts. Lima, the capital of Peru, was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535. Who was the same person who lead the coup to take over the incans. On April 5th, 1879, the war of the pacific started, which lead to Peru and Bolivia loosing to Chile, and forfeiting some of their costal territory to Chile on October 20th 1883. In the 20th century, Peru experienced economic challenge, which lead to social unrest and the rise of the Shining Path, which was a guerrilla movement.</p>
